## Build requirements
- Compiled using NetBeans and Java 8.
- Uses JUnit and Hamcrest for tests (yes, all 2 of them)

## Stuff that still needs doing
somewhoat sorted in order of importance:

- EPWING support
- Support for the special case verbs in the deconjugator or dictionary
- Misc. work on deconjugator (more tests etc.)
- a built-in text hooker or some sort, probably using JNA
- Multiplayer testing/repair (code is there, but it's broken right now)
- More JUnit tests
- UI for settings, adding words to dictionary and such

Please report bugs here if you find them!
