# Spark-Reader
A tool to assist non-naitive speakers in reading Japanese

Also my first project on Github

## Build requirements
- Compiled using NetBeans and Java 8. You can probably edit it in other IDEs too
- Uses JUnit and Hamcrest for tests (yes, all 2 of them)

## Stuff that still needs doing
somewhoat sorted in order  of importance:

- EPWING support
- Support for the special case verbs in the deconjugator
- Support for more conjugations in the deconjugator
- a built-in text hooker or some sort, probably using JNA
- Multiplayer testing/repair (code is there, but it's horribly broken right now)
- More JUnit tests
- UI for settings, adding words to dictionary and such (I was planning to use the NetBeans GUI editor for this, but that might not work out for other IDEs
