# Spark-Reader
A tool to assist non-naitive speakers in reading Japanese

Also my first project on Github

## Requirements
- Compiled using NetBeans and Java 8. You can probably edit it in other IDEs too
- Requires EDICT2 text file to run, edit settings.txt to point to it
- Uses JUnit and Hamcrest for tests (yes, all 2 of them)

## Stuff that still needs doing
somewhoat sorted in order  of importance:

- EPWING support
- Support for the special case verbs in the deconjugator
- Support for more conjugations in the deconjugator
- Multiplayer testing/repair (code is there, but it's horribly broken right now)
- More JUnit tests
- UI for settings and such (I was planning to use the NetBeans GUI editor for this, but that might not work out for other IDEs
