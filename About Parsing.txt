Automatically dividing a japanese sentence into its words is very useful and saves a lot of time, but there's three things it's bad for.

1) If you're an "absolute beginner", parsers will teach you wrong grammar, because parsers will always make mistakes (like grouping a compound word when it shouldn't, splitting it when it should be a compound, and dividing up series of hiragana characters wrong), and as an absolute beginner, you won't be able to identify or fix its errors.

2) If you're advanced, the parser will get in the way because "parser".

However, segmentation (and therefore the parser) has several advantages that make it very useful for intermediates and "upper beginners".

1) The parser saves you like 90% of the time spent segmenting text.

2) It lets the program track which words you know, and automatically treat words you don't know differently from ones you do. No more mousing over a word and saying "wait, I should have known that".

3) It makes it easy for the program to go from text to definition.

4) It makes errors in the original text more obvious.

5) It lets the program make it easy to make custom dictionary entries.
