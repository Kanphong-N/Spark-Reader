- If an option doesn't exist in the settings file and it's not in the UI(?), saving the options causes it to get written multiple times
- Deconjugator doesn't handle irregular verbs sensibly unless the form has its own dictionary entry (e.g. dekiru, arieru)
- Deconjugator doesn't understand stems (infinitives like the te-form and i-stem, and linking forms like the mizenkei form)
- Heuristics for default definition sorting are bad (e.g. many common particles are marked as "archaic" and downscored badly)

Wishlist:
- Parser doesn't understand grammar at all and can't guess whether a given segment is a particular part of speech (like kuromoji does; however kuromoji's segmentation runs much deeper than spark's and extends to segmenting conjugations internally, etc)
- The above would be useful even for manual segmentations if it could say "the next term is „Å†, this is probably a noun"
