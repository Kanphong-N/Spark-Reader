- Add a way for deconjugation rules to "reject" themselves based on their context.
For example, teru should refuse to happen inside a stem form if the stem form is the end of the segment.
Mizenkei, izenkei, and the unstressed infinitive should refuse to be the end of a segment.
etc.

- Add a way for the segmenter to "rewrite" common parsing mistakes.
For example, N|はこ|いつ being rewritten to N|は|こいつ.
This is actually relatively easy to add but will probably cause obscure problems.

- Add rules that only allow specific edict entries (どう -> どうだ etc)

- Restructure new optimizations/fixes to obey OoP modularization
