Importing guide

=============================
==importing words from Anki==
=============================
Spark Reader cannot import from Anki directly.
However, you can use 3rd party addons for Anki that let you export your cards.
Search for "csv" or "export" to find a few. Make sure that the seperator is set to 'tab' or '\t' if you have the option.

At this stage, you can optionally remove words which you don't yet know by deleting them from the file with a text editor.
-With the 'export cards as csv' tool, they are in the order they would come if you choose to do new cards in order,
 so you can find the last word you learnt and delete everything past it (unless you've set Anki to learn words in a random order)
-If using 'export browsers card list to csv file [enhanced]',
 you can first sort and/or filter out the cards you haven't reviewed before exporting.

Finally, open Spark Reader, click on the menu icon on the topright corner and click import.
Find the csv file you exported. Your words should now be imported!

==============================
==importing from other tools==
==============================
If the program has a csv export option, you can use that and follow simmilar steps to the above to import your word list.
Alternatively, you can type out all the words in a text file (1 word per line) and import that.

==importing Kanji deck from Anki==
==================================
Right now, this is only set up for the NihongoShark Heisig Kanji deck, and using the 'export cards as CSV' plugin: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1589071665
Once exported, name it kanji.csv and put it in the same folder as the program file (or change it in settings.txt to wherever you watn)

===========================
==exporting words to Anki==
===========================
You can export words from the right click menu. The currently visible definition and first reading will be used.
When you've collected some words, you can import the generated file (forAnki.csv by default)
and assign the various fields to fields of your own cards (I recommend making custom cards to take in all the fields)
Once imported, you can delete the forAnki.csv so that you don't end up importing duplicates the next time
